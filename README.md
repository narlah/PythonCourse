# Pythonicas
Wanted to check out Edx platform.
So i started a course about basic computer lesson with python.
Wanted to do just few of the slides but python turned to be interesting language on its own.
It is pretty good for small scripts during my linux adventures too, tho bash is ok most of the time.
It is very good for "leetcode" and hacker rank too. Haven't done interviews with it yet tho. Despite its verbosity -
for me java is a cleaner language.

# Pythonicas
Wanted to check out Edx platform.
So i started a course about basic computer lesson with python.
Wanted to do just few of the slides but python turned to be interesting language on its own.
It is pretty good for small scripts during my linux adventures too, tho bash is ok most of the time.
It is very good for leet code and hacker rank too. Havent done interviews with it yet tho. Despite its verbocity - java is cleaner for me.
